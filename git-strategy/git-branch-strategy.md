## **✅ What is a Branching Strategy?**

A **branching strategy** is a way to **organize and manage code changes** in Git. It defines:

- 📂 **When to create branches**
    
- 🔄 **How to merge them**
    
- 🚀 **How to release code to production safely**

---

## **#1 Feature Branch**

The simplest strategy:

- **main** → Holds the **stable production code**.    
- **feature branches** → Used for **new features or bug fixes**.

- You can have 1 or multiple "feature branches in an organization"
	- This will be for any new feature that your organization is working on
- The **feature branches will eventually be added back into the "main"** branch

✅ **Pros:** Simple, good for small projects.  
⚠️ **Cons:** Not good for **team collaboration**.


## **#2 Release Branch**

- Remember, that any application you are working on, will have to be delivered to the customers
	- To deliver the application to the customer, instead of "building the application from the main" branch, **we will usually "build the application from the release branches that were created from the latest of main branch** 
	- For example, when all your testing is successful, and you want to deliver the code to the customer, you will create the "release branch", and **you the deliver (or ship) this release branch to the customer** (before merging it back into main)
	- Once the release branch has been delivered and confirmed, it can then be merged back into main branch (and probably delete the feature branch too in the process)
- Why not deliver the code from the "main" branch? because "Main is kept for active development"
	- Example of this; there can be people who actively work on main branch
- An example of this strategy is Kubernetes, as they use this same model


## **#3 Hotfix Branch**

- Sometimes you get a very critical issue on production, and you need to deliver new code immediately to the customer, in such cases you create a hotfix branch
- Hotfix branches are mostly short-lived, as you only need to make the critical changes and quick testing before applying the fix
- Tricky things is you deliver this hotfix branch to the main branch as well as the release branch, but "you then deliver the release branch to the customer"


# 🌟 **#4 Gitflow Branching Strategy (Advanced & Popular!)**

This is a powerful strategy for **large projects**. It introduces more branches for better **control and organization**.

- **main** → Production-ready code
    
- **develop** → Latest development changes
    
- **feature/** → New features in progress
    
- **release/** → Code ready for deployment
    
- **hotfix/** → Urgent fixes on production

### 🔹 **How it Works:**

1. **Start a feature from `develop`:** 
```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/login-page
```

2. **Work on your feature**, then merge back to `develop`:
```
git checkout develop
git merge feature/login-page
```

3. Prepare for release:
```
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
```

4. Finish the release and merge into main:
```
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
```

5. Tag the release:
```
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```

6. Hotfix if needed:
```
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
```

✅ **Pros:** Organized, safe, scalable for big teams.  
⚠️ **Cons:** More complex, needs good Git understanding.


# 🔥 **#5 Trunk-Based Development (Modern & Fast)**

- All development happens directly on **main** with **short-lived branches**.
    
- Frequent merges to `main`, usually **multiple times per day**.

### 🔹 **How it Works:**

1. Create a short-lived branch:
```
git checkout -b feature/small-change
```

2. Work fast and push quickly:
```
git commit -m "Added validation"
git checkout main
git merge feature/small-change
```

3. Deploy multiple times daily 🚀

✅ **Pros:** Fast, real-time integration, perfect for CI/CD.  
⚠️ **Cons:** Can get messy if not disciplined.


# 🔄 **#6 GitHub Flow (Simplest CI/CD Approach)**

Perfect for **cloud-native apps** and **CI/CD pipelines**.

|**Branch**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|`main`|Always production-ready|
|`feature/*`|New feature development|
### 🔹 **How it Works:**

1. Branch off of `main`:
```
git checkout -b feature/add-login
```

2. Work on the feature, commit, and **open a PR (Pull Request)**.
3. Merge back into `main` when approved.
4. 🚀 **CI/CD automatically deploys it!** 

✅ **Pros:** Extremely simple, great for **cloud deployments**.  
⚠️ **Cons:** No built-in release or hotfix separation.
